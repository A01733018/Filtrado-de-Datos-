A must-see is the ancient Sanctuary of Santa Maria alla Fontana, dating back to 1500, in whose underground area one can find a spring with healing properties and the Fonderia Napoleonica Eugenia where bells were made and bronze casting such as that for the statue of Vittorio Emanuele II in Piazza Duomo was carried out.

Traveller, happy mother of 3 children, I was an expat  in Egypt and Greece for many years.
I adore Milano and Italy, reading books, skiing, listening to good music, yoga and food from around the world.
I never say no to a glass of red wine and to a chat with good friends. 
I love Greece where I spend all my summer holidays, and I dream of moving back there one day...
